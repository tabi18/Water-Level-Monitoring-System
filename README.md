# Water-Level-Monitoring-System
The project is a water level monitoring system that utilizes a water level sensor, LCD display, and buzzer. It provides real-time information on the water level, indicating whether it is high or low, along with the corresponding percentage. The LCD display visually communicates the current water level status, while the buzzer emits an audible alert specifically when the water level is low. This system aims to enhance water level awareness and facilitate timely actions for maintenance or refilling purposes.
